Definition of Classes and Objects:

-Class: A class in Java is simply a template, or a blueprint, which defines the structure and behavior of objects. It does not contain any actual data, only specifying what attributes and behaviors an object will have. Essentially the same as a stencil, in which it outlines the object and shows what it should look like.&nbsp;

-Object: An object is an actual instance of the class, holding space in memory. It has real values assigned to it's fields and can use the behaviors which were defined in the class.&nbsp;

For any nerds out there, I feel like this is best described with the clone troopers in Star Wars being modeled after Jango Fett. Jango Fett defined the attributes and behavior of the class, with each clone trooper being an object, or a singular instance of that class. It demonstrates the reusability of code that a class provides, which saves time and resources. Even like the Marine Corps, of which I was proudly a part of, a class could be delineated by a training manual. It could state the training level and resultant capabilities of a recruit that goes through boot camp. One thing that is important to note is that each object actually takes up space in memory, it has it's own unique values and can call any methods that refer to it. So just like the clone troopers, or Marines in real life, they can have different names, ranks, and perform tasks. So in the programming realm, it is important to remember that you just need one class and from there, you can create as many objects as needed from it, and as memory allows, in order to execute your intended program.
